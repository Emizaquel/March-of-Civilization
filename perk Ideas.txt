Spiritual; Wisdom of the Ages; With a name and enough identifying information to uniquely describe them, you can use the atemporal nature of the soul to call upon the shade of anyone who has died. This state does not harm them nor is it inherently uncomfortable, and indeed, the two of you cannot interact in any way bar harmless communication. Convincing them to part with their secrets is up to you to do; 250
Powers; Guy In The Chair; You don't need to be on the scene to help. So long as you have a real-time ability to influence the situation, you can bring your full might towards helping out; 500
Powers; Neat Trick; You can add aesthetic and otherwise non-functional flourishes to your work without needing to spend any more time than if you focused your efforts on a purely functional barebones piece; 0
Powers; Shapeshifting; You now have a supernatural ability to manipulate your body, which grows stronger each time you roll this perk. At first you might only manipulate your tissues, reshaping them into altered forms. Then you power extends to genetic expression allowing you to change what properties your tissues express. Your penultimate upgrade is your ability to manipulate your very DNA, altering the foundations of your physical form.Finally, your power extends even to the materials around you, enabling you to integrate even inorganic materials into your body, reshaping them as you see fit; 300; 4
Powers; Infomorph; Your mind and soul now have a stronger connection. This ensures that any upload of your mind is indeed you for all intents and purposes - magical or otherwise. Your mind can also heal from imperfect transfers given time, drawing upon the information stored in your soul; 0
Planar; There's something there; You have a sense for the unlikely, the potential timelines where the uncommon occur. You are able to influence your vicinity such that uncommon outcomes are more likley to happen to you; 450
General; True Genius; You have a natural aptitude for seeing connections and patterns, beyond the norms of your kind. What's more, your observations tend to be accurate more often than not - allowing you to come to conclusions others might miss; 200
Martial; Blood Pills; You know how to create pills from your own blood and Ki that can store vast amounts of your vital energy. Each pill contains close to a 120% of your Ki reserves at the time of creating the pill and combined with the medicinal components of the pills, they can even provide a mild regenerative effect allowing you go from exhausted to fighting fit in moments, as though you had a good meal and a full night's rest; 150
Alchemical; Calcination; You understand how to alchemically seperate solids into their component calxes, displaying unique qualities of the source materials. Each material can be split into dry True Calxes and wet Salts; 75
Alchemical; Distillation; You know how to alchemically distill liquids seperating them into purer forms with Hot and Cold propeties; 75
Alchemical; Sublimation; You know how to extract the airy spirits from solids through the alchemical process of Sublimation, capturing materials that are paradoxically hot and dry without manifesting the properties of flame; 75
Alchemical; Descension; You know how to extract the earthly elements from liquid reagents, precipitating the dry and cold properties of a fluid into a pure state; 75
Alchemical; Solution; You have learned to imbue the properties of non-fluid materials into fluids, allowing you to create liquids with the properties of a variety of different substances; 75
Alchemical; Coagulation; You know how to combine the earthly properties of different liquids to extract a solid substance, seperating them into component parts; 75
Alchemical; Fixation; You know how to force solids to take on the properties of liquids and gasses, imbuing them with additional useful traits; 75
Alchemical; Ceration; You know how to soften materials through various alchemical processes, granting them properties not unlike metal or wax, introducing Wet properties unto the substance; 75
Martial; Pressure Points; You gain the ability to identify precise locations on the body of your own species as well as any body that you have had the opportunity to carefully examine, growing stronger with each time you toll this perk. First you learn how to manipulate muscles, forcing them to activate, relax or even enter a chaotic series of spasms. Next you learn how to manipulate the senses, dulling or even amplifying them temporarily. Finally, you learn how to manipulate even involuntary processes. This can be used medicinally or simply to strike someone down with a precise poke; 150
Physics; Uncertainty; There is an underlying structure to the seeming chaos at the bottom of reality, and with the right knowledge it becomes possible to manipulate such a thing. You now understand the nature of uncertainty that dwells in the smallest corners of physics allowing you such feats as teleportation and pair production; 300
Physics; Heat; What by many is thought to be a wild and chaotic result of entropy has rules of its own. And while they may be complex, they can be manipulated. You now have deep and detailled understanding of how heat propogates and is effects substances; 200
Physics; Evolution; You understand how all sorts of systems respond to stimuli, especially those systems that can adapt. This goes beyond mere biological evolution, you are able to work out how any sufficiently complex conglmeration will change over time; 250
Physics; Structural Psychology; You have a deep understanding of how physical structures translate to operational function, something that applies especially well to logical systems. Though it might take you some time and experiments, you can even extrapolate the generalities of the thought processes and instincts of a lifeform with enough information about their nervous system or whatever analogue they may have, as well as the effect that stimulus and even alteration to those cognitive structures would have; 200
Physics; Experimental Psychology; You have a good sense on the externalised aspects of the mind, and with some study and experimentation, can fairly reliably predict the actions a conciousness will take in response to specific stimuli, 200
Physics; Ergonomics; You have a solid understanding of how people interact with the world around them, and as a result are able to create things that are natural, comfortable and intuitive to use. You can pick apart any body plan and design tools, equipment and other devices in such a way that they are a joy to work with... or a nightmare, 200
Physics; Cognitive Analysis; You are well versed in the workings of a mind, how to render even the seemingly chaotic realms of emotion into fairly clear workings. Through studies of people's actions you can extrapolate an accurate model their individual minds, or a more general set of trends; 200
Physics; Armchair General; You might not have put boots on the ground, but at the end of the day, it is logistics that win wars. You have the knowledge of someone who has studied hundreds, if not thousands of wars, and can plot out supply lines and deployments with ease. Not only can you utilise your own resources well, you can also analyse the movements of your foes to determine their strategies and plots; 200
Physics; Educational; You understand the workings of a mind well enough to understand how to best impart information unto it with whatever tools you so choose. While this mainly covers your own species, you have enough broadly applicable insight to adapt to others with a little practice; 200 
Psionics; Habitual; you gain the ability to instil habits into your mind and those of others, though that is much easier with their co-operation. This allows you to instil certain behaviours that they will feel natural doing and even find skipping somewhat annoying; 350
Psionics; Spoon Bending; Something of a parlour trick, but no less a useful telekinetic skill. You know how to project a small but still reasonable amount of force onto any point within ten centimeters of you. This isn't precise or well controlled at first, but is a fairly useful training exercise for those skills anyways; 0
Magic; Libromancy; You have gained an understanding of a set of skills focused on the manipulaiton of recorded information. Beginners know how to scry for specific information in large volumes of text, easily record and absorb such information as well as perform complex rituals to uncover the meaning of words in languages they do not speak. Adepts become capable of generating accounts of events, individuals and items that they have heard of uncovering facts that may have even been considered lost to time; 300; 3
Eldritch; Haunting Whispers; You can open your ears to the whispers of what lays beyond. Though be warned, even if it may not be useful to you, what you learn here is not for the faint of heart. Even if you mind might be able to handle it, your body may not, and spilling these secrets to others can have mixed results; 0
Eldritch; Persistent Whispers; You know how to phrase and reveal things in such a way that they remain in the minds of those who hear them; 0
Eldritch; Eternal; Your understanding of the underlying processes of the world allows you to create objects and structures that seem to be immune to deterioration - be it due to age, weather or otherwise; 0
Stuff; Conjurer's Container; You know an enchantment that can be applied to containers of all kinds, anchoring a pocket of space to them that massively multiplies the internal volume and hides the mass of all stored things from the outside world; 150
Planar; Planar Support Systems; The boundary of each plane is the first line of defence when it comes to any sort of extraplanar incursion. You know how to build complex and power hungry systems that will reinforce the barrier locally, with your systems able to project out to about five billion kilometres given sufficient power and enough installations to spread out the strain; 250
Planar; Corners of Existence; You have a deep understanding of spatial topology, enough to see where the conditions are just right that the dimensions are a little softer than they should be. It's more common than you would think! Regardless, you know how to make use of these spaces as stashes that fit more than you would think or even hiding places that most usually would not notice; 0
Martial; C-C-C-Counter!; Your reflexes are honed well enough that you can instinctively react to suprise attacks and other attempts to catch you off your guard, allowing you to attempt to defend yourself; 0





Update Hammerspace (typo) "You know how to create pocket realms that are integrated into the natural functions of living beings, allowing them to store items in a convenient and weightless manner."

note: save alchemical processes for next update, there's like 16
